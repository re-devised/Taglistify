Hashtaglists make life easier for social media users since one doesn't need to search new hashtags for every post.

The problem is that social media algorithms often downgrade posts with hashtags that one has used multiple times in the past.

Taglistify improves on this by randomly selecting Hashtags from your self defined Hashtaglists so that one uses new Hashtags in every post.

## Usage
### How to create Hashtaglists?
1. Create a text-document (.txt) in the same folder of the Taglistify.exe file and give it a name of your choice (eg. "travelhashtags.txt")
2. Write one hashtag per line in the document and save it:
```
#hashtag1
#hashtag2
#hashtag3
```
### How to use Taglistify.exe?
1. Taglistify lists all the .txt files in the folder to let you know which files you can use
2. Enter the name of the list you want to use. (Files get selected by closest match so if you want to select the file "example.txt" you can just type "exa")
3. Enter how many values you want it to return
4. Hashtags get randomly selected from the file and get coppied into the clipboard
5. Do the process again for another Hashtaglist

## Code
If you want to improve on the code then just download the python file and edit it however you want ;D
